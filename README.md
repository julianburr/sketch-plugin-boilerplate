# Sketch Plugin Boilerplate

The Sketch Plugin Boilerplate is targeted at JS Developers, who want to create awesome plugins for [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com), but don't want to have to go through all the Obj C frustrations to be able to do more complex stuff, like building GUIs, handling HTTP requests, etc.

I tried to use as little Obj C as possible, again, this is supposed to be a helpful starting point for JS developers.

<br>

> This is meant as a starting point, so clone the repo, modify anything and everything to your needs and build an awesome Sketch plugin

<br>

## Why
Sketch is awesome. And they provided us an awesome API to develop plugins. But as a JS Developer, there are still many things that are quite hard to achieve. The main problem I keep hearing of is the ability to build custom user interfaces (GUIs), which requires some knowledge of how web views work in Obj C, how you can communicate with them and then **a lot of** boilerplate.

This repo should make it easier and faster to start new projects :)


## Getting started

Let's say you want to name your project `MyProject` and locate it at `MyPath`

```bash
cd MyPath

git clone -b features https://github.com/colorgmi/sketch-plugin-boilerplate.git MyProject
# [todo: git clone https://github.com/julianburr/sketch-plugin-boilerplate.git MyProject]

cd MyProject

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Build and watch plugin (Backend: js code)
yarn start 
# Notice: need to restart Sketch when code changed 
# Because we set `coscript.setShouldKeepAround(true)` for convenience and never set it `false`, so this is a long running JavaScript context; so can't reload unless restart Sketch.

# Another terminal
# Build and watch webview (Frontend: js and scss code)
yarn start:webview 
# Notice: when it done, open your Safari of url https://localhost:3000/ 
# Then manually trust the localhost certificate in Keychain Access Application of Mac
# And then, Sketch webview can load https://localhost:3000/

# Then make a symbol link from your project to Sketch Plugin folder
# This will install Sketch plugin
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/
mkdir MyProject.sketchplugin 
cd MyProject.sketchPlugin 
ln -s MyPath/MyProject/Contents .
```
Now, you can open Sketch Application, and open your plugin.
And you can change your frontend code, and backend code(need Sketch restart).
This way, you develop your plugin like a full stack developer.

```bash
# Bundle your project
yarn bundle
```

```bash
# Run eslint --fix on the source directory
yarn lint-fix

```

For the rest, see `package.json`


## Folder structure

**Why is the folder structure as it is**

The build structure follows [Sketch's guidelines](http://developer.sketchapp.com/introduction/plugin-bundles/) of how your plugin has to be structured. This makes development so much easier. All you have to do is to create the repo in your Sketch plugin folder (usually `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/`) and start coding. The watch and build scripts automatically put everything in the right place so you see the changes immediately in Sketch :)

```bash
└─── /__tests__ # Jest tests and assets (e.g. Sketch files, etc) that are used for test scenarios
└─── /config # Here you will find all necessary configurations, feel free to adjust them to your needs! :)
│
└─── /Contents  # This is the build folder that Sketch reads
│    └─── /Resources  # Assets, frameworks, etc.
│    └─── /Sketch  # plugin.js and manifest.json have to be here
│    
└─── /scripts  # The npm scripts, also feel free to change to your needs, this is a boilerplate, not an end product!
│    └─── /plugin  # For `yarn *:plugin` scripts
│    └─── /webview
│    
└─── /src  # Source code, split into the different parts of your plugin
│    └─── /framework  # Any xcode cocoa frameworks you want to load into your plugin
│    └─── /objc  # Your objective c code of framework
│    └─── /plugin  # The plugins JS source code
│    │    └─── index.js  # By default, this will be used to bundle your production plugin.js file
│    └─── /webview  # The source for possible web views
│    
└─── package.json  # By default, the version of your package.json will be copied into the plugins manifest.json
```

## Documentation

*In progress*

## Roadmap / Todos

 - [x] ~~Create useful documentation (integrated into a simple github.io page)~~
 - [ ] Create tutorials for JS developers to get started with Sketch plugins
 - [x] ~~Implement testing ([Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)?)~~ *- Note: using [sketchtool](https://www.sketchapp.com/tool/) for accessing Sketch files and running plugin commands, however using own util functions, since the [node package](https://github.com/marekhrabe/sketchtool) does not seem to be maintained anymore (currently at version 39.x)*
 - [x] ~~Migrate the webview build from webpack to rollup, so we only have one build system to care about~~
 - [x] ~~Re-Implement `fetch` polyfill (see master before merge for old solution with cocoa framework and plugin action handler)~~
 - [x] ~~Try to get rid of cocoa framework if feasable~~

## About Testing

Testing is a bit of a question mark for Sketch plugins at the moment, as it's not that easy to unit test your plugin commands in the Sketch enviroment. I am currently working on a util library / plugin that lets you run and test Sketch commands with Jest or any similar JS unit testing framework. If you are interested, just hit me up, happy to share my progress on this and collaborate.
